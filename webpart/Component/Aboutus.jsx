              We are the members of the team SILICONITES . And our idea is to solve the problem of
              waste segregation . Key feature of our website and app is to locate
              the trash on a map and provide information to
              the people . Whenever a person throws garbage , he/she will notify us and hence itâ€™s location , amount and garbage type
              through our App.
              On WebSite and in App we will show how much and where the garbage is present in an areaon a
              map with the help of heatmap feature.
